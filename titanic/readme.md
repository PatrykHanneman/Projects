Titanic Survivability Prediction

This project predicts the survivability of Titanic passengers using Machine Learning models.

Dataset

The model uses the titanic.csv dataset, which contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, and survival outcome.

Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

How to Run

Open the Jupyter Notebook (survivability.ipynb).

Run all cells sequentially.

The model will output evaluation metrics and predictions.

Machine Learning Models Used

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Features and Processing

Data Preprocessing: Missing value imputation, scaling, and encoding.

Model Training: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Output

The model prints:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report
